## About

This project is designed for learning and experimentation with:

- Microservices using .NET 8
- Authentication with Keycloak
- Payment integration (Stripe and bKash)
- Containerization with Docker
- CI/CD using GitHub Actions

---

## Architecture

- **Microservices**: Each core domain (User, Order, Payment) is a separate .NET service.
- **Authentication**: Centralized with Keycloak (OpenID Connect).
- **Data Storage**: SQL Server for persistent storage, Redis for caching.
- **Communication**: REST APIs (Swagger enabled).
- **Containerization**: Only infrastructure dependencies (Keycloak, SQL Server, Redis) are orchestrated with Docker Compose..

- Workflow: Restores dependencies and builds the solution.
- Branch Protection: PRs and passing builds required for merging to Production.

### Note:
Update service ports and URLs as per your launch settings if they differ.
